Some 62% of ANC votersÂ polled by Ipsos disapprove of President Jacob Zuma while only 18% support him, suggesting that his continued presidency is exacting a heavy price on the party's electability. The poll, done in conjunction with eNCA, surveyed 3 500 adults between 21 April and 22 May this year. eNCA reported: "Zuma's current approval rating is the lowest score ever for any of the country's democratically elected presidents." The poll suggests that Zuma's support is in a tailspin after he showed he had the backing of 54% of ANC voters in December 2016. Some 65% of voters said Zuma should resign. The poll came as mounting evidence of Zuma's involvement in 'state capture' entered the public domain, causing senior ANC figures to distance themselves from him. Need to stay informed?
