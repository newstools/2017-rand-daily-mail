President Jacob Zuma erred by using a dodgy intelligence report to justify the sacking of Pravin Gordhan, but he would not be asked to step down, the ANC has said. At a media briefing in Johannesburg, the party’s secretary general reported instead that senior ANC officials who criticized his decision were responsible for unfortunate "public dissonance". “The ANC is gravely concerned about the breach of confidentiality between the alliance and the South African Communist Party,” he said, because they had leaked “the contents of a closed meeting”. Mantashe gently chided Zuma saying “consultation is a principal of the organization, not a favour”. “The prerogrative of the president, premiers and mayors … should be exercised after consultation with the leadership of the organization,” he said. He said the ANC’s National Working Committee “accepted the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship” between Zuma and Gordhan but was not impressed by the intelligence report “that was questioned from left, right and centre”. The ANC was fully behind the new ministers. “The ANC wishes them well in their new roles and calls on South Africans to rally behind them.” “The ANC has full confidence in the new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba.” Mantashe said of financial institutions: “There will be no tampering with the institutions.” Need to stay informed?
