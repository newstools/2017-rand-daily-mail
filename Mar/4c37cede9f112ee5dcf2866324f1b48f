The Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, has returned to South Africa after his investor road show to the UK was cut short by President Jacob Zuma. His plane touched down at Johannesburg International Airport this morning. In a move widely believed to presage the firing of Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, Zuma cut short the road show and canned one planned for the US in a terse one line statement issued on Monday. Gordhan was expected to be removed from office on Tuesday, but the passing of struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada in the early hours of the morning, may give Zuma pause. More to follow.
