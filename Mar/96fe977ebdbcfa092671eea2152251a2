Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has broken his silence and spoken out against President Jacob Zuma's decision to fire Pravin Gordhan. Ramaphosa and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe opposed the decision when it was presented to them at a meeting of the ANC's top six last night. Enca quoted him saying it was "unacceptable" that Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas had been fired. Ramaphosa cited the use of an 'intelligence report' purporting to prove that the two were using their platform to mobilise against Zuma. He said this reminded him of when he had been smeared by a fake intelligence report by President Thabo Mbeki. Need to stay informed? Published by Tiso Blackstar and distributed
