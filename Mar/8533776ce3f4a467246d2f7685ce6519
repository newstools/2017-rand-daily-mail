South African football is embroiled in another scandal.In banning Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey for life, Fifa said the outcome of South Africa's 2-1 home win in African Group D in November was contrived. The official was found guilty of influencing the result after handing South Africa a soft penalty for handball and allowing a second goal in controversial circumstances from a quickly taken free kick soon after in a qualifying match for the 2018 finals in Russia. Who had influenced Lamptey to help South Africa win the match was not addressed by Fifa. However, the world ruling body said: “Further information on the South Africa v Senegal match will be provided once the decision becomes final and binding.” Fifa officials, who did not want to be named, said match-fixing was uncovered following irregular betting activity. The SA Football Association did not respond to questions about the allegations. The revelation follows allegations South Africa paid a $10-million (about R125-million) bribe to help secure the rights to the 2010 World Cup and that officials were duped by an Asian betting syndicate over the results of warm-up matches before the finals. Although South Africa's Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula rejected the bribery allegation a year ago, the scandals have tarnished the legacy of the World Cup, said local experts. — Reuters Need to stay informed?
