Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor has revealed that some of her cabinet colleagues may be living beyond their means.She suggested some may receive questionable payments in addition to salaries. Pandor is now leading the charge for ANC leaders to undergo lifestyle audits, saying some cannot afford their lifestyles on their salaries. Speaking to the Sunday Times this week, Pandor said the ANC had failed to implement a decision taken by the national executive committee last year for party leaders' lifestyles to be scrutinised. "How would a colleague have a 13-bedroom house and another a three-bedroom house? [They have] 13 bedrooms in Sandringham or something and I have a three-bedroom in Claremont. "For me it just seems standard that we can begin to identify where there are problems if public institutions do their work," she said. Pandor questioned how some leaders owned paid-up houses and others were "going around getting $10,000 [about R125,000] or Ã 20,000 [about R270,000]", beyond their state salaries. "They should start asking questions about those people. It is well beyond what we earn. So this is what I am saying: are our institutions so useless that they are unable to identify some of these things?" - Sunday Times  Read the full interview here Need to stay informed?
