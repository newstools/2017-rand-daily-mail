President Jacob Zuma effected his latest Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday; a merry-go-round that saw no less than 10 changes to his ministers alone. In the biggest move‚ finance minister Pravin Gordhan was axed and replaced by Malusi Gigaba‚ formerly the home affairs head honcho. Zuma also fired Tina Joemat-Petterson and replaced her with ANC MP Mmamoloko Nkhensani Kubayi as energy minister. Kubayi was an ANC proportional representative councillor in Johannesburg from 2006 to 2009‚ and also the chairperson of portfolio committee on transport during the same period. She also served in the ANC Youth League‚ as a Provincial Executive Council (PEC) member in Gauteng. Dipuo Peters got the chop from the transport minister’s post and was replaced by an ANC PEC member from Limpopo‚ Joe Maswanganyi. In 2015 he was moved from the Limpopo executive and sent to parliament. At the time he was touted for a cabinet position. Public service and administration minister Ngoako was axed and replaced with Faith Muthambi. Muthambi was replaced in communications by Ayanda Dlodlo‚ who served as Ramathlodi’s deputy. Derek Hanekom has been fired from the tourism portfolio and replaced by his deputy‚ Thoko Xasa. Despite being at the helm of the social grants payment debacle‚ Bathabile Dlamini survived Zuma’s latest axe swinging. In a statement issued after midnight‚ Zuma said: “I have decided to make changes to the National Executive in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The changes bring some younger MPs and women into the National Executive in order to benefit from their energy‚ experience and expertise. I have directed the new Ministers and Deputy Ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues to bring about radical socio-economic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality.” Here’s an easy-to-understand list of who got chopped‚ who got shifted and who will be breathing a sigh of relief this morning: FIRED:Energy - Tina Joemat-Pettersson‚ FIRED and REPLACED by Mmamoloko “Nkhensani” KubayiFinance - Pravin Gordhan‚ FIRED and REPLACED by Malusi GigabaPublic Service and Administration - Ngoako Ramatlhodi FIRED and REPLACED by Faith MuthambiTourism - Derek Hanekom‚ FIRED and REPLACED by Tokozile XasaTransport - Dipuo Peters‚ FIRED and REPLACED by Joe Maswanganyi MOVED:Communications - Faith Muthambi‚ REPLACED by Ayanda Dlodlo and MOVED to Public Service and AdministrationHome Affairs - Malusi Gigaba‚ REPLACED by Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize and MOVED to FinancePublic Works - Thembelani Nxesi‚ REPLACED BY Nathi Nhleko and MOVED to Sports and RecreationPolice - Nathi Nhleko‚ REPLACED by Fikile Mbalula and MOVED to Public WorksSports and Recreation - Fikile Mbalula‚ REPLACED by Thembelani Nxesi and MOVED to Police RETAINED:Health - Aaron MotsoalediBasic Education - Angie MotshekgaSocial Development - Bathabile DlaminiHigher Education – Blade NzimandeState security - David MahloboCooperative Governance - Des van RooyenEconomic Development - Ebrahim PatelEnvironmental Affairs - Edna MolewaRural Development - Gugile NkwintiPlanning‚ Monitoring and Development - Jeff RadebeHuman Settlements - Lindiwe SisuluPublic Enterprises - Lynne BrownInternational Relations - Maite Nkoana-MashabaneJustice - Michael MasuthaLabour - Mildred OliphantMineral Resources - Mosebenzi ZwaneScience and Technology - Naledi PandorArts and Culture - Nathi MthethwaWater and Sanitation - Nomvula MokonyaneDefence - Nosiziwe Mapisa-NqakulaTrade and Industry - Rob DaviesAgriculture‚ Fisheries and Forestry - Senzeni ZokwanaTelecommunication and Postal Services - Siyabonga CweleWomen in the Presidency - Susan Shabangu - TMG Digital.
