The events that unfolded on the parliamentary precinct on Thursday evening showed the nation that the ANC under Jacob Zuma has broken Parliament‚ broken the Constitution and broken the country‚ Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said. He said the violence in Parliament did nothing for the millions of South Africans still living in poverty‚ and without hope. “They must be disheartened and appalled at the events of this evening‚” Maimane lamented. He said the mission to remove the ANC and save the country’s democracy was now more urgent than ever. “The violence and disorder witnessed this evening is the direct result of a corrupt political party clinging onto power by using fear tactics and intimidation. “The army and riot police were deployed to bully Members and journalists‚ pepper spray was used in the Parliamentary chamber‚ and Members of Parliament were physically assaulted and removed from the chamber‚” the DA leader said. He said Parliament ought to be a place where the public could engage with issues facing the nation. “It is deplorable that ordinary members of the public were pepper sprayed while attending this evenings sitting. “But Jacob Zuma and his ANC planned this mayhem. Days before SONA‚ the Parliamentary precinct‚ the streets surrounding‚ and the inner city were swamped with thousands of police officers‚ riot police and the military‚” Maimane charged. He added: “We unequivocally condemn the deployment of the army and riot police inside the precinct of Parliament. We must now take legal action to ensure that security forces are never used in Parliament again. Tonight showed that such action is now essential.” - TMG Digital Need to stay informed?
