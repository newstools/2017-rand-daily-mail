Orlando Pirates will anounce a new coach "next week‚ Monday"‚ said Bucs' chairman at a press conference at Rand Stadium on Monday. Speaking in the wake of Bucs' disastrous 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday‚ which sparked a pitch invasion and ugly scenes of violence‚ Khoza said such a result was unacceptable to Pirates. Augusto Palacios's position as coach has always been in the capacity of a caretaker. Khoza said the quest to find a replacemet on a full-time basis for Muhsin Ertugral‚ who quit in early November‚ has been hampered by candidates being contracted elsewhere. He said one particular candidate Pirates have their sights on has current contractual issues. "This afternoon we will be meeting with the technical team to identify the problem‚ because clearly there is a problem‚" Khoza said. "The candidate we have indentified‚ as promised to make an announcement at the end of January‚ is currently contracted elsewhere. "What I can gurantee is that next week Monday we will be announcing a new coach." Saturday's 6-0 defeat was a record loss margin for Pirates. It followed SuperSport United thrashing Bucs 6-1 in November to equal the previous record‚ resulting in Ertugral's resignation. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport Need to stay informed?
